"By kluex, we found it! It was a near thing, but Davidson stumbled upon a small opening and had one of his famous hunches. So we dug. The bridge was a hassle, but well worth the effort. There's a temple down there...unlike anything we've seen before. What race built this place?",
"I've seen to permissions to begin digging into the actual antechamber.",
"Not much to report. Slow going-progress.",
"Davidson slit his own throat last night. Serves him right, disturbing the temple like that. There was a reason the opening was so small. He should have listened.",
"It's my turn now. They want my organs, and who can blame them? I'll just sit here and wait. I am willing to die if it feeds He who came before!"
