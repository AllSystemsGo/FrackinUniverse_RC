"^green;Lab Notes, Date 23446.2^white; - I've finally done it! I've corrected the base sample in the Array! Yes, it was Sam's idea. But screw that guy. He smells repulsive, like Dave's shoes. So, what you need to do for a stable DNA sample is easy: You'll need glass for the test tube, genetic material and some tissue cultures. Let that stuff sit in the sampler for a while. Voila!",
"John got the same general results from mixing glass with raw minerals and nutrient paste. The resulting combined samples were quite useful in the Gene Design Lab."
